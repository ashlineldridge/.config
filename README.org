* .config

My dot files including Emacs configuration.

To set up a new computer:
- Clone this repository into =~/.config=
- From within =~/.config= run =make bootstrap=

Note: After a major MacOS upgrade you might need to perform the following to get Emacs working:

#+begin_src bash
xcode-select --install
brew reinstall gcc
brew reinstall libgccjit

# And then update LIBRARY_PATH in ~/.config/emacs/early-init.el
#+end_src
