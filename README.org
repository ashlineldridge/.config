* .config

My dot files including Emacs configuration.

To set up a new computer, clone this repo into =~/.config=, install [[https://brew.sh/][Homebrew]] and then =brew install just=. Once =just= is installed, run =just install-all= to install the Homebrew packages, Emacs, Cargo & Go binaries, etc.

To remove all Emacs packages and native compilation files, run =just clean-emacs=. To update Emacs, run =just update-emacs= (which is just an alias for =just install-emacs=).

Note: Sometimes after a major macOS upgrade I've needed to do the following to get Emacs working again:
#+begin_src bash
xcode-select --install
brew reinstall gcc
brew reinstall libgccjit

# And then update LIBRARY_PATH in ~/.config/emacs/early-init.el
#+end_src
